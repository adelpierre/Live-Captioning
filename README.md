# Live-Captioning
Master's Degree project at ENSEA Graduate School, an algorithm that can describe the live feed of a webcam. Developped by Yoser Manaa ([page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yoser-manaa-16204b134/)), Frédéric Lavner ([page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric-lavner/)) and Adrien Delpierre.

Sadly results aren't as good as expected, still room for improvments (especially since we worked on a rather small dataset).

Also adding a poster made for our presentation to clarify.
