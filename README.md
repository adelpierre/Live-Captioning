# Live-Captioning
Master's Degree project at ENSEA Graduate School, an algorithm that can describe the live feed of a webcam. Developped by Yoser Manaa, Frédéric Lavner and Adrien Delpierre.

Sadly results aren't as good as expected, still room for improvments (especially since we worked on a rather small dataset).

Also adding a poster made for our presentation to clarify.
